# All that is gold
A quick project to test out some ideas for how we can use RShiny in 
[the department](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/school-public-health/infectious-disease-epidemiology/).

In particular, how much freedom do we have to style things as much as we would
with a vanilla HTML/CSS app?

The current version uses knockout to sidestep a lot of Shiny's fairly
uncustomizable UI widgets.

## Prerequisites
* Node.js and npm
* R

## Install dependencies
Run

```
./bootstrap
```

to install JS and R dependencies.
